This is just a little about me:

Hi, my name is Ryan. I started teaching myself how to code in the fall of 2017...I think haha. Either way I really fell in love with it and enjoy solving problems and building things. At the end of this past summer I decidecd I want to pursue it further through education. I'm currently attending Lambda School in their Full-Stack web track - which is basically an extended remote bootcamp that takes extra time to teach computer science fundamentals. Right now, I'm in the computer science section learning about graphs using Python. I'm really enjoying it thus far (at week 19 of 30), but it's hard to meet people in a 100% remote environment. So I'm looking forward coming out to meetups in the future and getting involved on a local level. Hello!
